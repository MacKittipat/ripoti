ripoti
======

Web application for generating time spent report.

At my current company, We uses Scrum framework. By the end of every sprint we have to make a report about how long do we spent on each task in Jira (https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira). That's mean we have to go through each task in Jira and write task name and time spent in Word processing and then export it as PDF file. It is too boring and time consuming.

With Ripoti we can generate report within a few click. Ripoti fetch task name and time spent from Jira via REST API and generate report for us. It is convenient and fast.
